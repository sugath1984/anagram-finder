You are required to implement a program which is able to print out all anagrams of a specified string.
Two strings will become anagrams if letters of one string can be rearranged to obtain the other string. 
For example, the string "rats" is an anagram of "star".
Your first step is to load the given dictionary (words_anagram.txt) into a hash table enabling the user 
to efficiently look for anagrams of a given word/s. 
The user should have the facility to specify anagram queries through stating the required word/s. 
The output should print out the given string/s along with the number of matching anagrams and the corresponding list 
of anagrams retrieved from the hash table.

       Example :     traps   	sprat  	strap
                    	opt		top	 pot
                    	star	rats
 
      Note: The matching anagrams that the program prints out may be ordered differently.
